## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

codeQuest is built on a decoupled, asynchronous architecture to ensure scalability, security, and a responsive user experience.

### Main Components:

* **Browser (Client):** The user interface where users interact with the platform.
* **Next.js Server:** The primary server that handles user requests, authentication, and database interactions.
* **PostgreSQL Database:** The central database for storing user data, problems, submissions, and test case results.
* **Judge0 API Server:** A dedicated, third-party service that compiles and runs user-submitted code in a secure, sandboxed environment.
* **Redis Queue:** Used by Judge0 to manage and distribute code evaluation tasks to its workers.
* **Webhook Handler (Node.js):** A separate service that listens for results from Judge0 and updates the database accordingly.

## üîÑ Core Workflows

### 1. User Code Submission & Judging

This workflow is fully asynchronous to prevent blocking the main server and to handle computationally expensive tasks efficiently.

1.  **Submit Code:** A user submits their code through the online editor.
2.  **API Request:** The Next.js server receives the code, language, and problem ID.
3.  **DB Entry:** A new submission record is created in the PostgreSQL database with a **`Pending`** status.
4.  **Offload to Judge0:** The server sends the code, test cases, and a webhook URL to the Judge0 API.
5.  **Asynchronous Evaluation:** Judge0 queues the submission in Redis and executes the code against all test cases in a secure, sandboxed environment.
6.  **Webhook Callback:** Once evaluation is complete, Judge0 sends the results (Accepted, Rejected, etc.) to the webhook handler on Render.
7.  **Update DB:** The webhook handler updates the submission status in the database.
8.  **Poll for Results:** The user's browser polls the Next.js server to get the final result, which is then displayed.

### 2. Adding New Problems (Git-based)

This workflow leverages GitHub and GitHub Actions to create a robust, version-controlled system for managing problems.

1.  **Contribution:** A new problem is submitted via a Pull Request (PR) to the public **`admin` repository**.
2.  **Validation & Merge:** The PR is reviewed and, if approved, merged into the `main` branch of the `admin` repo.
3.  **GitHub Action (Step 1):** The merge triggers a GitHub Action that opens a new PR from the `admin` repo to the main `web` repository.
4.  **Deployment Merge:** This second PR is reviewed and merged.
5.  **GitHub Action (Step 2):** This merge triggers a final GitHub Action that:
    * Downloads the new problem files.
    * Upserts the problem data (title, description, boilerplate code) into the PostgreSQL database.
6.  **Problem Live:** The new problem is now available on the platform for users to solve.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* npm or yarn
* PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1.  **Clone the `web` repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/codequest-web.git](https://github.com/your-username/codequest-web.git)
    cd codequest-web
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install

    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="your-postgresql-database-url"
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
    JUDGE0_URI="[https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com](https://judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com)"
    X_RAPIDAPI_KEY="your-rapidapi-key"
    X_RAPIDAPI_HOST="judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com"
    JUDGE0_CALLBACK_URL="your-render-webhook-url"
    ```

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```
